    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Discussion 8.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    <li>The history of computing, and some of the people who were important along the way</li>
  </div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://www.tehchinghsieh.com">Tehching Hsieh</a>.</div>
  <div>His most famous work is "One Year Performance 1980-1981" - he spent 12 months punching a time clock every hour, on the hour, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/30/tehching-hsieh-the-man-who-didnt-go-to-bed-for-a-year">Read more here</a>.
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Tehching's work is about time passing, which is why he's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">The Jacquard Loom</a> was the worlds first programmable object.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> is the inventor of the concept of a digital computer. Babbage was aware of the Jacquard Loom and expanded upon the punch card to invent both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> was the worlds first computer programmer, even realising that the computer could be used to make music and art.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a> pioneered a grammar that incorporated metarules and recursion - making the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a> formalised algebra, his name gave rise to the word algorithm and introduced the decimal system to the western world.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_al-Jazari">Ismail al-Jazari</a> invented programmable machines, including programmable humanoid robots and an astronomical clock considered the first programmable analogue computer.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> formalised the concept of the algorithm and computation in general. During the Second World War he led the team that broke German Naval codes. He went on to design one of the first stored program computers and did pioneering work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis">Morphogenesis</a>, or how living things form themselves. He was prosecuted by the British Government for being gay, and committed suicide in 1954. If an system is capable of general computation it is said to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> is a test of machine intelligence in comparison to human intelligence.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Flowers">Tommy Flowers</a> was the engineer who built Turing's machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> invented the compiler for translating between human readable code and machine code.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)">Margaret Hamilton</a> led the development of on-board flight software for NASAs Apollo Moon missions.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pioneers_in_computer_science">A further list of pioneers in Computer Science</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">Software bugs</a> began with real insects!</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">Hacker culture</a> is about curiosity, not breaking into computer systems. You are all hackers now.</li>
