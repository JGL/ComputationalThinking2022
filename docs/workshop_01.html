    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Workshop 1: signing up to GitHub, learning Git, using editor.p5js.org, downloading VSCode, using VSCode with p5.js on your own computer, running a local server, duplicating a p5.js example on editor.p5js.org and locally.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, we'll have covered:
    <ul>
      <li>Signing up to GitHub</li>
      <li>Learning Git</li>
      <li>Using editor.p5js.org with your GitHub login</li>
      <li>Downloading VSCode</li>
      <li>Using VSCode with p5.js on your own computer</li>
      <li>Running a local server via the VSCode "Live Server" extension</li>
      <li>Duplicating an example on editor.p5js.org and locally</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Signing up to GitHub</div>
  <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> is a website that enables you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> to store, edit and share all your code with other developers around the world. Git is software for tracking changes to and sharing those changes with other programmers.Git is open source, while GitHub is owned by Microsoft. Both are free to use. Github is the industry standard website for programmers - employers may look at your GitHub to see what kind of code you write and how you help others.</div>
  <div>Sign up to GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a> - please use a non university email address to do this, so you can keep logging in after you've graduated. Pick a username that you wouldn't be embarassed to apply for a job with! I'll give you 5 minutes to do this.</div>
  <div>Learning Git</div>
  <div>I can't give you a complete tutorial on Git right now. GitHub provides a good set of learning resources here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources">https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources</a> . I recommend going through this after the Intensive is over, you won't need it for the rest of the week.</div>
  <div>Using editor.p5js.org with your GitHub login</div>
  <div>The easiest way of coding with p5.js is to use the amazing online editor that p5.js itself provides: <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">https://editor.p5js.org</a>. It's totally free and you can log into it with you GitHub login.</div>
  <div>While you try logging in, watch me complete the editor.p5js.org part of the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">p5.js get started tutorial</a>.</div>
  <div>Give it a try yourself! You have 10 minutes.</div>
  <div>Downloading VSCode</div>
  <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</a> or VSCode is a free and open source text editor that is designed for programming software. You can download it for free here: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">. The brilliant Daniel Shiffman has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJw0SyKO9IU">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec">different</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCHzlUiDD10">videos</a> on how he codes locally (not using the p5.js online editor, only working on his own computer). It's the piece of software that I use to write code, write lectures and organise my todo lists.</a></div>
  <div>Using VSCode with p5.js on your own computer</div>
  <div>While you are downloading VSCode, I'll complete the other half of the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">p5.js get started tutorial</a>, BTW we are using VSCode instead of the Sublime Text editor, which is very similar.</div>
  <div>Give it a try yourself! You have 15 minutes.</div>
  <div>Running a local server via the VSCode "Live Server" extension</div>
  <div>Sometimes you'll need to run a local web server in order for your p5.js sketches to run on your local laptop. The <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">p5.js get started tutorial</a> has instructions for installing a server, but I prefer to use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">VSCode Live Server extension</a> to start up and shut down a server really easily. Follow along and install it for yourself while I demonstrate it. You have 5 minutes.</div>
  <div>Finally, I'd like you to pick a <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5.js example</a> and first try it on the <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXs1cOlidWs">p5.js editor</a> (don't forget to check the File > Examples menu!), and then get it running on your local machine - I'll show you how to do that myself first, demonstrating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuGsp5KeJMM">errors, the console</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJcrPJuem5Q">comments too</a>. A few "Coding Train" links there, if you want to go into more detail!</div>

    Thanks! Time for a short break!
