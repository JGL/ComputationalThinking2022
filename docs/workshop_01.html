    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Workshop 1: what Git and GitHub are, signing up to GitHub, using editor.p5js.org, downloading VSCode, using VSCode with p5.js on your own computer, running a local server, duplicating a p5.js example on editor.p5js.org and locally.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, we'll have learnt about:
    <ul>
      <li>What Git and GitHub are</li>
      <li>Signing up to GitHub - the best place to find and share code</li>
      <li>Using editor.p5js.org with your GitHub login - this is the way we will make code for the rest of the week</li>
      <li>Downloading and using VSCode - a really useful text editor for writing code on your own computer, but not something we'll use for this intensive</li>
      <li>Running a local server via the VSCode "Live Server" extension - this is how I develop code when I'm on my own laptop</li>
      <li>Duplicating a p5js example on editor.p5js.org</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Before we start, I wanted to share a lovely analogy that Rocio suggested for what we are doing in this workshop: "we are setting up tools to get coding or get started with resources to find code, just like gathering materials you might need for other crafts like painting". I hope that's helpful!</div>
  <div>Signing up to GitHub - the best place to find and share code</div>
  <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> is a website that enables you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> to store, edit and share all your code with other developers around the world. Git is software for tracking changes to and sharing those changes with other programmers.Git is open source, while GitHub is owned by Microsoft. Both are free to use. Github is the industry standard website for programmers - employers may look at your GitHub to see what kind of code you write and how you help others. It's the first place I go to find code to use in my own work.</div>
  <div>But what does that really mean? What problem does Git (and GitHub) solve? Over to <a href="https://youtu.be/BCQHnlnPusY?t=57">Daniel Shiffman</a> for a great explanation. (BTW, Dan's whole playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV">"Git and GitHub for poets</a> is the one I'd recommend to learn more about them both). There are lots of great resources for learning creative code online and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain">Dan's YouTube channel " The Coding Train" is the one that I recommend above all others</a>.</div>
  <div>Sign up to GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a> - please use a non university email address to do this, so you can keep logging in after you've graduated. Pick a username that you wouldn't be embarassed to apply for a job with! I'll give you 5 minutes to do this.</div>
  <div>Using editor.p5js.org with your GitHub login - this is the way we will make code for the rest of the week</div>
  <div>ü•Å Drum roll please! This is the website we are going to be using to make creative code for the rest of the week!</div>
  <div>The easiest way of coding with p5.js is to use the amazing online editor that p5.js itself provides: <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">https://editor.p5js.org</a>. It's totally free and you can log into it with your GitHub login.</div>
  <div>First, watch me complete the editor.p5js.org part of the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">p5.js get started tutorial</a> on <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">https://editor.p5js.org</a>.</div>
  <div>Second, give it a try yourself! You have 10 minutes.</div>
  <div>Downloading and using VSCode - a really useful text editor for writing code on your own computer, but not something we'll use for this intensive</div>
  <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</a> or VSCode is a free and open source text editor that is designed for programming software. You can <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">download it for free here</a>. The previously mentioned, brilliant, Daniel Shiffman has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJw0SyKO9IU">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4D3wDRaec">different</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCHzlUiDD10">videos</a> on how he codes locally (not using the p5.js online editor, only working on his own computer). It's the piece of software that I use to write code, write lectures and organise my todo lists.</a></div>
  <div>Now I'd like to take a moment to go over the structure of a p5.js sketch - showing how a webpage (index.html) combines with some javascript code (sketch.js) and a stylesheet (style.css) to make a complete program that runs on the web. Let's also talk about what a library, console and server are - a good place to bookmark for all of this information is the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/JavaScript-basics">JavaScript basics tutorial on the p5.js GitHub wiki</a>, which is like a Wikipedia, but just for p5.js.</div>
  <div>Running a local server via the VSCode "Live Server" extension - this is how I develop code when I'm on my own laptop - again, not something that you'll need for the rest of the week, but something that is good to know about.</div>
  <div>Sometimes you'll need to run a local web server in order for your p5.js sketches to run on your local laptop. The <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">p5.js get started tutorial</a> has instructions for installing a server, but I prefer to use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">VSCode Live Server extension</a> to start up and shut down a server really easily. I'll demonstrate how I do that on my own copy of VSCode, from start to finish.</div>
  <div>Finally, I'd like you to pick a <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5.js example</a> and try it on the <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXs1cOlidWs">p5.js editor</a> (don't forget to check the File > Examples menu!), and I'll also show you some very useful things in the p5.js editor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuGsp5KeJMM">errors, the console</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJcrPJuem5Q">comments too</a>. A few "Coding Train" links there, if you want to go into more detail. So let's start by me demonstrating how to run an example on editor.p5js.org, and show the console, errors and comments, before you pick an example for yourselves.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
