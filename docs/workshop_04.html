    This afternoon we are going to complete four exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. As I said this morning, I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>
    We are going to pick up the pace this afternoon, with 20 minutes for each of the four exercises.
  </div>
  <div>A reminder from this morning: I'd recommend making these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js edtior at https://editor.p5js.org</a> - easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Left or Right" before we all try it on our own on the p5.js editor. Any suggestions?
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's talk about the "Billiard Ball" exercise, before we try it individually in the p5.js editor. Any thoughts?
  </div>
  <div>
    Next is the "Seven Circles" exercise. How you make something that repeats a shape across a screen?
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's look at the "Transitioning Rectangles" exercise. You'll need to change several graphical elements for each repeated rectangle for this exercise.
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
