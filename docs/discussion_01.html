    This first discussion session is one where we introduce ourselves to each other.

  <div>I'd like you to use your new GitHub ID to edit the wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/ComputationalThinkingIntensiveSummer2020/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/ComputationalThinkingIntensiveSummer2020/wiki</a>. I'll take you through how to add to it using Cheska's and Rocio's information. Make sure to cut and paste your information, not deleting anyone elses. Also, it's best to make sure you have the text saved somewhere in case it gets deleted.</div>
  <div>You have 15 minutes. Don't forget to save your text somewhere in case it gets deleted. Go!</div>
  <div> Let's spend the last 15 minutes going through the list of participants.</div>
