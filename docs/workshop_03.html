  <div>
    This morning we are going to complete two exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>Before we work on the two exercises, I'd like to show you three important sources of information about p5.js: the forum, the reference and the examples.</div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the
    <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">p5.js forum</a>. What can we find? Let's try searching for things as well as browsing.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's take a look at the
    <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference</a> - I always have this open when I'm writing code. Don't forget that all the code examples are editable right in your browser! Even on mobile!
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's take a look at the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5.js examples</a> - let's try cut and pasting them into new sketches using your new p5.js editor login. Do they work? Why did you pick the ones that you did?
  </div>
  <div>
    Now that we are familiar with the forum, reference and examples, let's try two exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>: "Drawing Your Initials" and "Draw, then Code".</div>
  <div>By the way, I'd recommend making these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js edtior at https://editor.p5js.org</a> - easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Drawing Your Initials" before we all try it on our own. How should we tackle this? Let's spend half the remaining time on this exercise before moving onto "Draw, then Code".
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Draw, then Code" before we all try it on our own. How should we tackle this?
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
