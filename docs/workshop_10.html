    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Workshop 10: p5.js Sound Library, p5.gui and Rita.js<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>For this workshop we are going to spend 30 minutes each on making p5.js sketches that include the following libraries:
    <ol>
      <li>p5.sound</li>
      <li>Rita.js</li>
      <li>p5.gui</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>For the first 30 minutes, let's take a look at the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.js reference page for the p5.sound library</a>, and some of the examples there. </div>
  <div>Now, let's take a look at the examples included on <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">ditor.p5.org</a> - how to search the examples and particularly the index.html code to include the p5.sound.js file.</div>
  <div>For the next 30 minutes, let's take a look at <a href="https://rednoise.org/rita/">rita.js by Daniel Howe</a>. Let's have a look at the examples on the p5.js online editor and also some of the projects that have been made with it.</div>
  <div>Helpfully, <a href="https://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a> has posted <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/external-libraries/">a great tutorial on how to use external JavaScript libraries with p5.js (with rita.js as the example library)</a>, let's go through it together and get it going in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">p5.js editor</a>.</div>
  <div>For the final 30 minutes, let's put everything together by duplicating some of the <a href="https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui">p5.gui examples from GitHub</a>, adding them to a new editor.p5js sketch, and coming up with some new things to do with our GUI.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
