    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Discussion 10.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>This will be our last session, I wanted to put up a few prompts for directions you might go with your new knowledge, before having a chat.</div>
  <div>The main thing I want you keep in mind today is that you can use your p5.js knowledge to create work, but also as a springboard to software development in general. I'd also like you to think about how you can use your new knowledge to recreate artworks from the past or to create new design systems. Those are just two approaches - what is your approach going to be? Why? What are you a geek for? It could be ANYTHING, as long as it's truly yours. Remember: ordinary+extra attention = extra-ordinary!</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>Zach Lieberman's Recreating The Past (RTP) course</li>
      <li>A source of inspiration for RTP: radicalart.info</li>
      <li>Andreas Cwervo's work on AR on the web</li>
      <li>Rune Madsen's work on Programming Design Systems</li>
      <li>Jason Webb's work on digital morphogensis and Nervous System as an example of a business built around taking inspiration from the natural world</li>
      <li>Jeffrey Alan Scudder's work on radical digital painting</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Zach Lieberman's <a href="https://rtp.media.mit.edu/">Recreating The Past (RTP) course</a>. <a href="https://github.com/ofZach/RTP_MIT_FALL19">2019 Github</a>. <a href="https://github.com/ofZach/RTP_SFPC_SUMMER20">2020 Github</a>. Why is this course interesting? A great way of finding your way is retracing other's steps.</div>
  <div>A source of inspiration for RTP: <a href="https://www.radicalart.info/">radicalart.info</a>. I'm still working my way through this resource. It's amazing!</div>
  <div>Andreas Cwervo's work on <a href="https://cwervo.com/writing/quicklook-web/">AR on the web</a>. Why is this interesting? I think it's a great way for the sculptors and 3D artists to distribute your work throughout the world on an unlimited scale.</div>
  <div>Rune Madsen's work on <a href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com/">Programming Design Systems</a>. I want you all to become system designers. Whichever field you are in - go meta. Don't just make a project, make the tool or the system for making that project.</div>
  <div>Jason Webb's work on <a href="https://github.com/jasonwebb/morphogenesis-resources">digital morphogensis</a>. Why I am I interested in this? I think the natural world is the most interesting thing available to us. Similarly to RTP, I think it's important to learn from evoluation by trying to re-create interesting things, in order to make more interesting things in the future. <a href="https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">Nervous system are a great studio that takes inspiration from natural systems (are there any other kind?)</a>. Some more experiments from Jason:

  <div><a href="https://jas.life/">Jeffrey Alan Scudder</a>'s (aka Just Another System (-;) work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2-myTEviE">radical digital painting</a>. Bonus! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csalhuSixQU">Jeffrey meeting Mr. Kid Pix</a>. Have any of you ever heard of Kid Pix? Why do I like Jeffrey's practice? It's fun, innovative and makes me think about my own practice in a new way. What kind of life do you want to design for yourself and others around you?</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please give me a shout via email or Instagram with any feedback or if there is anything I can help you with - my practice is about helping other people make the things they want to. Also, <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">come to CCI - either for the Diploma, MSc or PhD</a>, I'd love to see you again there.
