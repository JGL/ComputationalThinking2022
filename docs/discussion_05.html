    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: Discussion 5: Creative uses of multiple dimensions and Timothy Morton<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Creative uses of multiple dimensions:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://universaleverything.com/projects/motorstudio-design-room">Motorstudio Design Room </a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyNHJQzn3pw">Hermès × Tokujin Yoshioka</a> / <a href="https://www.clairesophie.com/shining360excerpt">Shining360 by Claire Hentschker</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton">Timothy Morton</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/15/timothy-morton-anthropocene-philosopher">who isn't an artist at all</a>.</div>
  <div>I was first drawn to his work by <a href="https://twitter.com/the_eco_thought/status/714803735470297088">this tweet</a> and his book, <a href=" https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/hyperobjects">Hyperobjects</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Hyperobjects are a "objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium". It really helped me start to think about why we aren't doing anything about global warming and what artists and designers can do about that.</div>
  <div>N.B. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology">Object orientated ontology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object orientated programming</a> are not the same thing. But they do use the same word. So there!</div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for lunch! See you back at 1400!
